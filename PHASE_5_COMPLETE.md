## 🔧 How It Works

### **Flow Diagram**
```
User clicks "Edit"
  → Modal opens with card data
  → User edits fields
  → User clicks "Save"
  → Mutation sends PATCH request
  → API validates and updates database
  → React Query refetches cards
  → UI updates automatically
  → Modal closes
```

### **Code Example**

```typescript
// Open editor
<button onClick={() => setEditingCard(card)}>
  Edit
</button>

// Editor handles the rest
<CardEditor
  card={editingCard}
  isOpen={!!editingCard}
  onClose={() => setEditingCard(null)}
  onSave={handleSaveCard}
/>

// Save handler
const handleSaveCard = async (updates: Partial<Card>) => {
  await updateMutation.mutateAsync({
    id: editingCard.id,
    updates
  })
}
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **For Testing**
- Use [Picsum Photos](https://picsum.photos/) for random test images
- Use [Sample Videos](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4) for testing
- Test with various YouTube/Vimeo URLs

### **For Content**
- Keep titles short (2-5 words)
- Text content works best at 50-200 characters
- Use high-quality images (min 800px wide)
- Test videos load quickly

### **For UX**
- Order matters - drag cards to arrange story flow
- First card should be welcoming
- Last card should have clear CTA
- Use mix of text/image/video for variety

## 🎯 Recommendation

**→ Build the User Carousel next!**

The admin dashboard is fully functional now. Users can:
- ✅ Create cards
- ✅ Edit content
- ✅ Reorder with drag-and-drop
- ✅ Delete cards

But there's no way for **regular users** to see the onboarding experience yet!

The carousel is the **core user-facing feature** that makes Compass valuable. Once that's built, you'll have a complete, working product.

**Ready to build the carousel?** Just say "continue" or "build user carousel" and I'll start Phase 6! 🚀
